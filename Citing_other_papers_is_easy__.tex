My a-priori expectations for the effect of the various alternative-specific variables and choice of flight are described in the below table
\begin{table} 
    \begin{tabular}{ c c c }
        Variable & Influence on P(i) & Potential Interactions \\ 
        Travel Time & -, large & Trip Purpose, Age, Ticket Class \\ 
        Aircraft & small preference for bigger plane &  \\ 
        Departure Time & - for late night, early morning (11 PM-8 AM?)+ for other times & Trip Purpose, Age \\ 
        Arrival Time & - for late night, early morning (11 PM-8 AM?)+ for other times & Trip Purpose, Age \\ 
        Arrival Time Difference & -, more - for being late than early & Trip Purpose \\ 
        On-time Performance & +, small & Trip Purpose \\ 
        Fare & -, large (if paid for directly) & Payment, Income \\ 
        Airline & +, large if airline matches basic and/or elite status of individual. Maybe additional preference for certain airlines regardless of status (e.g. b/c of reputation) &  \\ 
    \end{tabular} 
    \caption{A-priori assumptions about the effect of alternative-specific variables on flight choice. Note that age, gender, income could likely interact with all variables, but the table above identifies my assumptions about the variables with which they would have the strongest interaction}
